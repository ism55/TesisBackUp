abstract = "This paper presents a low cost open structure motion controller for the industrial robot PUMA 560. Due to the ?black box? fashion of most commercial robot controllers which can be neither accessed nor modified, a PC based ?home made? motion control system has been developed to replace the original commercial controller of the Unimation PUMA 560 robot manipulator. Rather than adopting the traditional SUN-VME and UNIXVxWorks based set up, which is quite expensive, our control system is simply based on a novel low-cost PC-QNX-Windows95 (NT) configuration. The system developed consists of a 6 DOFs robot arm, a personal computer based controller running QNX multi-tasking realtime operating system and Photon GUI, a real time 3D graphical animation of the robot arm and remote control of the robot arm through QNX network."

   Abstract = {This paper investigates ways to create algorithms to invert
   Laplace transforms numerically within a unified framework proposed by Abate and Whitt (2006).
   That framework approximates the desired function value by a finite linear combination of transform values,
   depending on parameters called weights and nodes, which are initially left unspecified.
   Alternative parameter sets, and thus algorithms, are generated and evaluated here by considering power
   test functions. Real weights for a real-variable power algorithm are found for specified real powers and
   positive real nodes by solving a system of linear equations involving a generalized Vandermonde matrix,
   using Mathematica. The resulting power algorithms are shown to be effective, with the parameter choice
   being tunable to the transform being inverted. The powers can be advantageously chosen from series
   expansions of the transform. Experiments show that the power algorithms are robust in the nodes;
   it suffices to use the first n positive integers. The power test functions also provide a useful
   way to evaluate the performance of other algorithms.},

   Abstract = {A mechanistic method of finding the next step in an arbitrarily large fast Fourier transform at an arbitrary stage is outlined. The method starts by writing down two different forms for the discrete Fourier transform of a sampled function and converting one into the other by decomposition using partial fractions. The process demonstrated corresponds to decimation in time. The alternative of decimation in frequency is demonstrated through an analogous procedure using the Laplace transform of a sampled function. It is suggested that the method should help in understanding the organization of a large-scale FFT. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
